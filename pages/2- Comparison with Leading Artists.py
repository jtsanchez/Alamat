1. Increase suitability for dancing - a possibility to be translated to gain popularity through TikTok (social media app for people dancing to songs)
2. Increase Energy of songs - more intensity and activity to their songs
3. Decrease the Key (from G to E) - this can also help when performing live 
4. Increase Loudness (from -7 db to -4 db) 
5. Increase speechiness - integrate more lyrics or words into the song
